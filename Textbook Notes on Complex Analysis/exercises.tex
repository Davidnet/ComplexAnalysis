\begin{exc}
	The roots of a general cubic equation in $ X $ may be viewed (in the XY-Plane) as the intersections of the $ X$-axis with the graph of a cubic of the form:
	\[ Y = X^3 + AX^2 + BX + C \]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Show that the point of inflection of the graph occurs at $ X = \frac{-A}{3} $
	\end{itemize}
\end{exc}

\textit{Solution}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let us recall that an inflection point is a point on a curve at which the sign of the curvature (\textit{i.e,}, the concavity) changes, for a twice differentiable function, an inflection point is a point on the graph at which the \textbf{second derivative} changes sign. We observe then:
	\begin{align*}
	Y = x^3 + A x ^2 + BX + C \\
	Y' = 3x^2 + 2Ax + B \\
	Y'' = 3x + 2A
	\end{align*}
	and these change (or it is zero at):
	\[ x + \frac{2}{3}A = 0 \implies x = - \frac{2}{3}A  \]
\end{itemize}
