Review from the last time.
Observe that :

\[ \frac{\partial }{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2}(\parop{}{}{x} - i\parop{}{}{y}) \]
and that:
\[ \parop{}{}{\bar{z}} = \frac{1}{2\lrp{\parop{}{}{x} + i \parop{}{}{y}}} \]

Suppose that we want to try this with this function:

\[ f(x,y) = f(\frac{1}{2}(z + \bar{z},\frac{1}{2i}),(z - \bar{z})) = g(z,\bar{z})\]

we have the following chracterizaton that if $f$ satisfy cauchy riemman if and only if $\partial \bar{z} = 0$ that is, is independent of $ \bar{z} $.

Suppose $f = u + iv$, and we have  that 

\[ \parop{}{f}{\bar{z}} = \frac{1}{2}\lrp{\parop{}{}{x} + i \parop{}{}{y}}(u+iv) \]
so that:
is an homogenoeus system:
\[ \frac{1}{2}((u_x - v_y)) + i(u_y + v_x) \]


We now consider the following rational functions:

$P,Q$ polynomial, we consider now:

\[ R(z) = \frac{P(z)}{Q(z)} \]

Assume reduced fraction (no common root).
``Extended complex plane''  The Riemman Sphere.

we read ``a is closed to $ \infty''$ to be $\frac{1}{a}$ is closed to $0$.

we know to send $\CC$ is send to extended bar Riemman Sphere.

Observe that since the same rules for differentiation holds:

\[ R'(z) = \frac{P'(z)Q(z) - P(z)Q'(z)}{Q^2(z)} \]
not reduced also a natural forme, same poles as $\RR$.

order of Q is the same order of the same.

so observe that we can express that:

\[ R(z) = \frac{a_0 + a_1 + \ldots a_n z^n}{b_0 + b_1 \ldots b_mz^m} \]

and we can change in the following form:

\[ R_1(\omega = \frac{1}{z})\frac{a_0 + a_1w}{\qt{do it algebraically}} \]


Polling out the following

\[  = \omega^{k-m} \frac{a_0 \ldots}{a_1 \ldots }\]
do for this cases:

we conclude that 

Linear fractional transformations, of the whole sphere, 

We take polynomial and plug /
