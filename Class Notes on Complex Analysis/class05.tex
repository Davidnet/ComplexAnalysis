Observe that we meant that $f$ (for the real case variable) that $f$ admits a linear approxiamtion at (near) a.


\[ f(\vec{a} + \vec{h})  = f(\vec{a}) + \qt{ a linear function of }(\vec{h})\]
more formally, we define the function of $h$ as an error term. $ \epsilon \vec{h} $,
Important conditions on $ \epsilon $: `` decreases faster than linear as $ \vec{h} \rightarrow \vec{0} $'' 

so that we want:
\[ \frac{\abs{\epsilon(\vec{h})}}{\abs{\vec{h}}} \rightarrow 0 \]
Linear functions are continuous. 
Take $f(x) = 3x $, say $a \in \RR$, then $f(x) $ is continuous at $a$
